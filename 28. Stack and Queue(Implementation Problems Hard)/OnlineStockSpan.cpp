//Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that
//stock's price for the current day.The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number
//of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was 
//less than or equal to the price of that day.For example, if the prices of the stock in the last
//four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because
//starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.
//Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock
//today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was
//less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.Implement the StockSpanner class:
//StockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.
//int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.
