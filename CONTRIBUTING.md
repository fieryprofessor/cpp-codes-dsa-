# Contributing Guidelines

## üö´ Current Status: Not Accepting Contributors

**Important Notice**: This repository is currently **NOT accepting contributions** from external contributors. This is a personal learning repository maintained by Om Singh for educational purposes.

## üìö About This Repository

This is a **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning repository that serves as:
- A personal study resource for DSA concepts

- An organized collection of problem solutions
- A learning journey documentation

## üéØ Repository Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:
- **Learning**: Documenting the learning process of DSA concepts
- **Reference**: Providing well-commented code examples
- **Organization**: Maintaining a structured approach to DSA topics
- **Education**: Sharing knowledge with the community

## üìñ Understanding the Structure

04. recursion(basic)/ - Recursion fundamentals
05. hashing/         - Hash table implementations
06. sorting/         - Sorting algorithms
07. array problems/   - Array-based problems (Easy/Medium/Hard)
10. binary search/    - Binary search implementations
13. string problems/  - String manipulation
14-17. linked list/  - Linked list implementations
18. bit manipulation/ - Bitwise operations
19. advanced maths/   - Advanced mathematical concepts
20. sliding window/   - Sliding window techniques
21-22. heaps/        - Heap data structures
23-25. recursion/     - Advanced recursion and backtracking
26. stack and queues/ - Stack and queue implementations
```

## üîÆ Future Contribution Guidelines

If contributions are opened in the future, the following guidelines would apply:

### Code Standards
- **Language**: C++ only
- **Comments**: Detailed explanations for algorithms
- **Organization**: Follow the existing folder structure
- **Naming**: Use descriptive file names
- **Complexity**: Include time and space complexity analysis

### Quality Requirements
- ‚úÖ **Well-commented code** with clear explanations
- ‚úÖ **Tested implementations** that compile and run
- ‚úÖ **Proper documentation** of algorithms
- ‚úÖ **Consistent formatting** and style
- ‚úÖ **Educational value** for learners

### Submission Process
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch
3. **Implement** your solution with clear comments
4. **Test** your code thoroughly
5. **Submit** a pull request with detailed description

### What Makes a Good Contribution
- **Clear explanations** of the algorithm logic
- **Time and space complexity** analysis
- **Edge cases** handling
- **Educational comments** for learners
- **Consistent** with existing code style

## ü§ù Community Guidelines

Even though contributions are not currently accepted, you can still:

### Learning Together
- **Study** the existing implementations
- **Ask questions** through GitHub Issues
- **Share insights** in discussions
- **Provide feedback** on code explanations
- **Suggest improvements** for educational value

### Respectful Engagement
- **Be patient** with learning questions
- **Provide constructive** feedback
- **Respect the educational** nature of the repository
- **Follow the Code of Conduct** at all times

## üìû Contact Information

For questions, suggestions, or discussions:
- **Repository Owner**: Om Singh ([@fieryprofessor](https://github.com/fieryprofessor))
- **Email**: [ninjaplays792020@gmail.com](mailto:ninjaplays792020@gmail.com)

## üéì Learning Resources

This repository is designed to be a learning resource. Feel free to:
- **Study** the implementations
- **Practice** the problems
- **Learn** from the comments
- **Use** as a reference for your own projects
- **Share** with other learners

## üìù Notes

- From the Recursion Directory onwards, some questions use GitHub Copilot for faster development and better code explanations
- The repository focuses on **understanding** rather than just solving
- All implementations include **detailed comments** for educational purposes
- **Time and space complexity** are documented where relevant
